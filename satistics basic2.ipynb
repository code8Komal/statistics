They provide valuable insights into how much individual data points deviate from the central tendency measures (e.g., mean, median), helping us understand the degree of scatter or spread in the data. Here's how these measures are used:\n",

    "\n",
    "Example: Let's say you have a dataset of exam scores for a class of students, and the scores are as follows: [65, 72, 80, 89, 92]. The range would be: Range = 92 (maximum) - 65 (minimum) = 27. This tells you that the scores vary by 27 points from the lowest to the highest.\n",

    "Formula: Variance = Σ((xi - μ)^2) / (n - 1), where xi is each data point, μ is the mean, and n is the number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider a dataset of daily temperatures (in degrees Celsius) for a week: [20, 22, 19, 24, 21]. The mean temperature is 21.2°C. The variance would be calculated by finding the squared differences from the mean for each value, summing them, and dividing by (n-1). The variance is a measure of how much daily temperatures deviate from the weekly average.\n",
    "\n",

    "Standard Deviation:\n",

    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a more interpretable measure of the spread because it is in the same units as the data.\n",

    "Formula: Standard Deviation = √Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same example as above, if the variance of the daily temperatures is calculated to be 4.3 (square degrees Celsius), then the standard deviation is √4.3 ≈ 2.08°C. This tells you that, on average, daily temperatures deviate from the mean by about 2.08°C."

This means that the peak of the distribution (the mode), the center of the distribution (the median), and the arithmetic average of the data (the mean) all coincide at the same point.\n",

    "Median: As mentioned earlier, in a normal distribution, the median is equal to the mean and the mode. This is a result of the symmetric and bell-shaped nature of the normal distribution. The median represents the 50th percentile of the data, which is also the location of the peak of the distribution.\n",
